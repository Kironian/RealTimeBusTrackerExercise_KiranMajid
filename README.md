# RealTimeBusTrackerExercise_KiranMajid

// Description

This bus tracker serves to show my ability to use JavaScript, CSS, and HTML to create a map that can track/highlight locations such as bus stops. I have achieved this by using the DOM to reference API from an outside source, MapBox.api, to gather the map I needed, before using JavaScript to create functions that gathered the needed bus stops between Harvard and MIT as instructed.


// How To Run This script can be tested by downloading the .zip including the index, css, and js files. Once downloaded and unzipped, you may open the html file to test. It will show the first bus stop, before you click and the next are shown as each is highlighted using the pin. 

// Road Map of Improvements

In the future, I would like for each pin to remain on the screen. Right now they disappear, and I would like each location to remain after being shown as to avoid confusion for the viewer.
